# Gender vs Fear
Galvanize Capstone Project: Gender vs Fear 

## Objective
The objecive of this project is to find out if a key demographic of an individual has predictive power. To do this we want to see if a person's gender has a statistical signficance on their phobias. This is accomplished using Chi-Squared Hypothesis Testing. 

## Potential Use-Cases

## Data
To do this study we will be running a hypothesis test on the Young People Survey dataset which was made available on kaggle. The survey was done by participants found by members of a statistics class from a University in Slovakia. The survey was translated from Slovak into English, and contained over 1000 participants, ages 15 - 30. It was submitted in both electronic and written form. The dataset itself contains over 100 columns but for the purposes of the project, I only needed the columns related to Demographics and Phobias.
